# AWS Regions

## How to choose an AWS region?
* Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
Data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
* Proximity to customers
Reduced latency.
* Available services within a region
New services and new features aren't available in every region.
* Pricing
Pricing varies region to region and is transparant in the service pricing page.

## AWS availability zones
Each region has many availability zones:
* AWS region: Sydney (ap-southeast-2):
	* ap-southeast-2a
	* ap-southeast-2b
	* ap-southeast-2c

Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity.

The data centers are separated from each other, so that they are isolated from disasters.

They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.

## AWS Points of Presence (Edge locations)
Amazon has 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge locations & 11 Regional caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries.
Content is delivered to end users with lower latency.
